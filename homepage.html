        <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>What is phone blocking?</li>
          <p class="p-description">Phone blocking is a security feature that renders a stolen phone unusable. It
            prevents unauthorized access, usage, and activation of the device, thus discouraging theft and protecting
            your personal information.</p>

          <li>How does phone blocking work?</li>
          <p class="p-description">Phone blocking works by associating the unique identifier of the phone (IMEI number)
            with a block status in a centralized database. When a stolen phone is reported, the database is updated, and
            any attempts to activate or use the blocked phone are prevented.</p>

          <li>Can I block my lost phone?</li>
          <p class="p-description">Yes, you can block your lost phone as a precautionary measure. By reporting it as
            lost, the block status is activated, ensuring that even if someone finds the phone, they cannot use it.</p>

          <li>What information do I need to block my phone?</li>
          <p class="p-description">To block your phone, you typically need the IMEI number, which is a unique identifier
            assigned to each device. You can usually find the IMEI number on the phone's packaging, the back of the
            device, or by dialing *#06# on the phone's keypad.</p>

          <li>Will blocking my phone erase my data?</li>
          <P class="p-description">No, blocking your phone does not erase your data. It simply prevents unauthorized
            access and usage of the device. However, it's always recommended to regularly back up your data to ensure
            its safety.</P>

          <li>Can a blocked phone be unblocked?</li>
          <p class="p-description">No, a blocked phone cannot be unblocked through legitimate means. Once a phone is
            reported as stolen or lost and its block status is activated, it remains blocked permanently.</p>
